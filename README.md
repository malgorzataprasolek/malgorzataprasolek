## Hi there!
### My name is Gosia and I'm Junior Quality Assurance Specialist with one year of experience.

For the last year I have been ensuring quality of the emplo - a platform for organizations that helps automate business and communication processes. 
I've also supported the development team in testing projects for Grupa Pracuj S.A.
I'm interested in Slavic mythology. 
DIY is also my passion.  </br>
### Me in a few words: 
 - thorough and sensitive to detail,</br>
 - highly motivated to acquire new skills and qualifications,</br>
 - prepared to expand my knowledge in the field of software testing.
