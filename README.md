## Hi there!
### My name is Gosia and I am an aspiring Quality Assurance Specialist.
I've spent most of my career in graphic design, running my studio. During this work, not only have I designed but also analyzed the client's needs, documented them, and ensured quality at every stage of product development - from the idea to printing or electronic publication. </br>
### Me in a few words: 
 - thorough and sensitive to detail,</br>
 - highly motivated to acquire new skills and qualifications,</br>
 - prepared to expand my knowledge in the field of software testing.
